Takeaways
+++++++++

- Nutanix Calm is a fully integrated component of the Nutanix stack. Easily enabled, highly available out of the box in a Scale Out Prism Central deployment, and takes advantage of non-disruptive One Click upgrades for new features and fixes.
- By using different projects assigned to different clusters and users, administrators can ensure that workloads are deployed the right way each time.  For example, a developer can be a Project Admin for a dev/test project, so they have full control to deploy to their development clusters or to a cloud, while having Read Only access to production projects, allowing them access to logs but no ability to alter production workloads.
