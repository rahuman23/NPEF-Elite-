Oracle Lab 1: Using Swingbench
-------------

Create Testing Schema
++++++++

Swingbench is a 3rd party tools for testing Oracle database performance . It can provide OLTP or OLAP testing . You can download the swingbench http://dominicgiles.com/swingbench.html
Why we use this tool for the partner training , because the configuration of this tool are vary easy for someone who even no any Oracle experience
There are two job when we using Swingbench testing OLTP performance. First job, you need to create Schema (collection of testing tables and indexes ) .
Create the schema
Go to **/home/oracle/swingbemch/bin** , execute the **./oewizard** to build your schema.
